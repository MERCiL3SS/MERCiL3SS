- 👋 Hi, I’m @MERCiL3SS
- 👀 I’m interested in using GitHub to develop an idea that I have that I believe to be a good one.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to focus my skills and talents to build the big projects that I've always dreamed of doing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on using GitHub to build out an awesome project while utilizing a codebase that I think would be useful and cut down on ~70% of the initial build.
- 📫 How to reach me, my email is leslie@lesliejones.com
